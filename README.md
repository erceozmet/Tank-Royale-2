## 🎮 Game Features

- **16-player lobbies** with real-time combat
- **Battle royale mechanics** with shrinking map
- **Loot system** with permanent upgrades and temporary boosts
- **Skill-based matchmaking** (MMR system)
- **Global leaderboards** with ranking system
- **Optimized networking** with interest management

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Phaser.js, Socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Go (REST API + Game Server with 30 TPS)
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (user accounts, match results)
  - Cassandra (game events, telemetry - optional)
  - Redis (leaderboards, matchmaking queue, cache)
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Keyspaces)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Key Design Patterns
- **Client-side prediction** with server reconciliation
- **Lag compensation** (200ms state history buffer)
- **Interest management** (only send nearby entities)
- **Delta compression** for efficient networking
- **Authoritative server** for cheat prevention

   - Client-side prediction and server reconciliation
   - Lag compensation (200ms state history)
   - Interest management (only send nearby entities)

2. **Multi-Threading**
   - Worker thread pool for parallel game loops
   - Each worker handles 3-5 lobbies independently
   - True parallelism utilizing all CPU cores

3. **Distributed Databases**
   - PostgreSQL for relational data (ACID transactions)
   - Cassandra for high-volume event logs (time-series)
   - Redis for caching, queues, and leaderboards

4. **Scalability**
   - Designed for horizontal scaling
   - Stateless game servers
   - Redis-based coordination

5. **Security**
